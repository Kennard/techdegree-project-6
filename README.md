# A Static Node.js and Express Site

This site is a small portfolio of projects put together using Node.js and Express. The node_modules folder is excluded so after downloading you will need to load the required npm suporting packages via npm install. The app.js can be started using npm start.

The app.js files has code comments to follow along where different express elements begin such as: pug view engine, routes, static files, middleware and error handling.  

The style attributes are a little different in this version from the original mocks found in the mock up folder. I've added an additional CSS file 'extra.css' that adds a new layor of styling to a few elements. If you want the original style the extra.css style sheet can be removed.
